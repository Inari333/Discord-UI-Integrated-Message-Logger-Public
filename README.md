Does that little “edited” annotation annoy you? ✏️
Have you ever wondered what the original message was?
Did you ever make a bet with a friend… only for them to delete their message so it looks like you’re talking to yourself? 😅

With this extension, we say: No backsies! 🚫

Discord Integrated UI Message Logger acts as your personal note-taker 📝
It follows you everywhere and remembers everything.
That also means it only logs what you can see — no cheating, no spying 👀❌

✨ Features

Log all messages, including edited and deleted content, exactly as you receive them from Discord.

Display everything in a clean, friendly UI.

Follow you across every server, every channel, and every DM.

🔒 Privacy

Your data never leaves your computer.

What happens on your local machine stays on your local machine — just like your “study” folder 😉

No cloud, no tracking, no data sharing.

👨‍💻 About Me

I’m a full-time software engineer working on solo dev projects on the side.
I’m a bit of a perfectionist, so at first I hesitated to share this — and I wasn’t sure how many people outside my circle would be interested.

As you can see, premium features aren’t available yet — the extension is completely free for now 🎁
I’m just testing the waters before investing even more time into it.

If you like the project, I’d really appreciate it if you left a comment or some feedback ❤️
